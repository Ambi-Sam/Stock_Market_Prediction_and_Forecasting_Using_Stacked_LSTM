# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

This project focuses on predicting and forecasting stock market prices using a stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The stacked LSTM model is a powerful deep learning algorithm that can capture complex patterns and dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks like stock market prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the NSE-TATAGLOBAL dataset, which contains historical stock market prices for the Tata Global Beverages stock (NSE: TATAGLOBAL). The dataset includes features such as the date, open price, high price, low price, close price, and volume of the stock on different trading days.

You can download the dataset from the following link:
[Dataset Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice/master/NSE-TATAGLOBAL.csv)

Please place the downloaded dataset file in the directory before running the project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Stock_Market_Prediction_And_Forecasting.ipynb`: Main script to train the stacked LSTM model and make predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the main directory.
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the command jupyter notebook.
6. Open Stock_Market_Prediction_And_Forecasting.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
7. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The results of the stock market prediction and forecasting using the stacked LSTM model will be displayed and saved during the execution of the `Stock_Market_Prediction_And_Forecasting.ipynb` script. This may include visualizations of the predicted prices, evaluation metrics, and other relevant information.
